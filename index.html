        <h1>The Long Run</h1>
        <div class="subtitle">A Hierarchical Bayesian Analysis of Lifetime Mileage</div>
    </header>

    <main>
        <p>In the era of the "Quantified Self," we are obsessed with the granular. Our watches buzz when we hit 10,000
            steps; our apps generate heatmaps of our yearly activity; we chase weekly mileage targets with religious
            fervor. We are masters of the short term.</p>

        <p>But running is fundamentally a long game. It is a habit that, for many, spans decades—from the high school
            track team to the local 5K, and eventually to the Sunday morning shuffle of retirement. Yet, we rarely zoom
            out to the widest possible lens: <strong>The Lifetime Total.</strong></p>

        <p>How many miles does a human being actually run in a lifetime? Is 10,000 miles a lot? Is 100,000 miles even
            physically possible for an amateur? And where do you stand in the global distribution of human movement?</p>

        <p>The answer is surprisingly difficult to find. There is no central database that tracks every human from age
            16 to 80. To answer this, I built a <strong>Hierarchical Bayesian Model</strong> to estimate these
            distributions. By synthesizing global polling data, club records, and survey statistics into a Gaussian
            Mixture Model, we can look past the noisy daily averages and see the clear compounding effect of
            consistency.</p>

        <h2>1. The Conceptual Framework: The Three Tribes</h2>

        <p>If you attempted to calculate the "average lifetime miles" of the global population, the number would be
            statistically meaningless. It would be dragged down by the inactive majority and pulled up by the
            ultra-endurance minority, resulting in a figure that represents nobody.</p>

        <p>To model reality accurately, we must recognize that the population is not uniform. My model posits that
            humanity is divided into three latent groups—or "tribes"—each with distinct behavioral parameters:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>The Non-Runners ($\pi_N \approx 70\%$):</strong> This group represents the structural zero. They
                may walk, cycle, or lift weights, but their contribution to "running mileage" is effectively nil. In the
                model, they are represented by a Dirac Delta function at zero.</li>

            <li><strong>The Casual Runners ($\pi_C \approx 24\%$):</strong> The vast majority of the "active" running
                population. These are the seasonal joggers, the "New Year's Resolution" crowd, and the recreational 5K
                participants. Their volume is generally low, centering around <strong>11 miles per week</strong>
                (~576/year), and their participation is intermittent.</li>

            <li><strong>The Core Runners ($\pi_D \approx 6\%$):</strong> The dedicated minority. These are the
                individuals for whom running is a "keystone habit." They average <strong>35 miles per week</strong>
                (~1,820/year) and, crucially, they maintain this consistency for decades.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>2. The Mathematical Model</h2>

        <p>To move from concept to calculation, we need a rigorous statistical framework. We model the probability
            density of Lifetime Miles ($M$) for an individual at age $t$ using a <strong>Gaussian Mixture Model
                (GMM)</strong>.</p>

        <p>The posterior equation is defined as follows:</p>

        <div class="math-block">
            $$ P(M | t) = \underbrace{\pi_{N} \delta(0)}_{\text{Non-Runners}} + \underbrace{\pi_{C} \mathcal{LN}(M;
            \mu_C(t), \sigma_C^2)}_{\text{Casual Runners}} + \underbrace{\pi_{D} \mathcal{LN}(M; \mu_D(t),
            \sigma_D^2)}_{\text{Core Runners}} $$
        </div>

        <h3>Deconstructing the Parameters</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>$\pi$ (Weights):</strong> These represent the probability of a random individual belonging to a
                specific group. Through the fitting process (detailed below), these settled at approx. 70%, 24%, and 6%.
            </li>
            <li><strong>$\delta(0)$ (Dirac Delta):</strong> This handles the "Zero Mass." It ensures that the model
                accounts for the fact that a huge portion of the population has 0 lifetime miles.</li>
            <li><strong>$\mathcal{LN}$ (Log-Normal Distribution):</strong> We use Log-Normal rather than Normal
                distributions because mileage is strictly positive and "heavy-tailed." A small number of people run
                <em>orders of magnitude</em> more than the median.
            </li>
            <li><strong>$\mu(t)$ (Accumulation Function):</strong> This is the heart of the model. It represents the
                accumulated volume over time. For Core runners, this function grows linearly and aggressively; for
                Casual runners, it grows slowly and often plateaus as they age out of the sport.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. Data Constraints & The "Herron Limit"</h2>

        <p>A Bayesian model is only as good as its priors and constraints. To ensure this simulation reflects reality, I
            did not guess the parameters. I fitted them using a <strong>Hierarchical Loss Function</strong> against
            three specific "anchors" found in recent real-world data.</p>

        <p>I programmed a Python simulation to generate 50,000 synthetic lifetimes, calculated the resulting population
            statistics, and optimized the parameters to minimize the error against these three sources:</p>

        <h4>Anchor A: The Casual Median (Source: Runner's World & Strava)</h4>
        <p>According to the <strong>Runner's World 2023 Survey</strong>, most recreational runners clock between 10 and
            19 miles per week. However, the <strong><a
                    href="https://downloads.ctfassets.net/9olkiac82a1q/iU421iiO6Hky1MVvYThmz/cf2f510407b1b16be35d1c323722f47a/Strava-Global-Report-2023-en-US.pdf">2023
                    & 2024 Strava Year in Sport Reports</a></strong> note that the median run distance is just under 4
            miles, with a median weekly distance around 8.1 miles/week for typical users.
            <br><em>Model Constraint:</em> I penalized the model if the Casual group's median annual volume drifted far
            from the combined estimate of roughly <strong>576 miles/year</strong> (approx 11 mpw).
        </p>

        <h4>Anchor B: The Core Volume (Source: Running USA & Academic Studies)</h4>
        <p>Defining the "Core" runner requires looking at the dedicated amateur. The <strong><a
                    href="https://www.runningusa.org/running-usa-news/running-usa-releases-2025-global-runner-survey-findings-with-largest-response-ever/">Running
                    USA Global Runner Survey</a></strong> reveals a highly committed demographic that participates in an
            average of 11 events per year. Furthermore, academic studies on marathon training (e.g., <em><a
                    href="https://www.dovepress.com/physiological-and-training-characteristics-of-recreational-marathon-ru-peer-reviewed-fulltext-article-OAJSM">Gordon
                    et al., 2017</a></em>) identify a "sweet spot" for serious recreational runners at around <strong>35
                to 50 miles per week</strong>.
            <br><em>Model Constraint:</em> I tuned the Core group parameters ($\mu_D$) to center around <strong>1,835
                miles/year</strong> (35 mpw). This separates the "Core" from the "Elite" (who might run 3,000+ miles)
            and the "Casual."
        </p>

        <h4>Anchor C: The "Herron Limit" (Source: 100k Lifetime Miles Club)</h4>
        <p>This is the most novel constraint in the model. In 2022, ultrarunner <strong>Camille Herron</strong> became
            the youngest person ever inducted into the <strong><a
                    href="https://www.100klifetimemiles.com/p/runners-by-name.html">100,000 Lifetime Miles
                    Club</a></strong> at age 40.</p>
        <p>This provides a powerful statistical boundary (a "Zero Probability Condition"). It implies that the
            probability of a human reaching 100,000 miles <em>before</em> age 40 is vanishingly small. If my model
            predicted that even 0.01% of 40-year-olds had 100k miles, the model would be fundamentally broken.
            <br><em>Model Constraint:</em> I applied a heavy penalty to the loss function if the tail of the
            distribution at Age 40 exceeded 100,000 miles. This "pinched" the variance ($\sigma_D$), ensuring the model
            respects the physiological limits of the human body.
        </p>

        <h2>4. Visualizing the Results</h2>

        <h3>The Cumulative Distribution (CDF)</h3>
        <figure>
            <img src="output_file_cdf_final.png" alt="CDF of Lifetime Miles Run by Age">
            <figcaption>Figure 1: Percentile rankings by age. The vertical line at x=0 represents the Non-Runners. The
                curves then flatten, showing the massive gap required to reach the top percentiles.</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>The CDF in Figure 1 illustrates the "S-Curve" of running. The graph stays flat at y=0.70 because 70% of
            people are non-runners. To enter the top 10% of the global population at Age 70 (the Red line), you need
            approximately <strong>20,000 lifetime miles</strong>. To reach the top 1% (Elite Core), you need nearly
            <strong>90,000 miles</strong>—equivalent to running around the Earth 3.5 times.
        </p>

        <h3>The Probability Density (PDF)</h3>
        <figure>
            <img src="output_file_pdf_final.png" alt="Distribution of Lifetime Miles for Runners at Age 60">
            <figcaption>Figure 2: The distribution of miles for runners at Age 60. Note the bimodality (two peaks).
            </figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>Figure 2 reveals the most fascinating insight: <strong>The Valley of Inconsistency.</strong>
            <br>When we look at runners at Age 60, we see two distinct peaks. The left peak (~6,000 miles) represents
            the Casuals who ran for a few years and stopped. The right peak (~45,000 miles) represents the Core runners.
        </p>

        <p>Notice the dip in the middle. Very few people end up with 20,000 or 30,000 miles. Why? Because that volume is
            too high to reach by accident, but too low for a lifetime habit. Statistically, you either dabble or you
            commit. There is very little middle ground.</p>

        <h2>5. Interactive Calculators</h2>

        <p>Based on the fitted parameters from the simulation (Casual $\approx$ 576 miles/yr, Core $\approx$ 1,835
            miles/yr), I have built these calculators to help you estimate your own horizon.</p>

        <h2>6. Conclusion: The Compounding Effect</h2>

        <p>The "Long Run" perspective offers a refreshing antidote to daily performance anxiety. When you view running
            through the lens of a lifetime, speed becomes secondary to longevity.</p>

        <p>The difference between the Casual and Core peaks in the data is not pace; it is persistence. A Core runner
            averaging 10-minute miles will eventually build a "statistical tower" of volume that dwarfs a faster runner
            who quits after five years.</p>

        <p>If you are struggling with a slow run or a lack of motivation, remember the data. Every mile deposits into an
            account that compounds over decades. You are not just running for today's workout; you are deciding which
            tribe you belong to.</p>

            </li>
            <li><strong>American Time Use Survey (ATUS 2024)</strong>: Provides the 1.5x activity duration gap used to
                model Gender differences.</li>
            <li><strong>Academic Studies (RunRepeat, Frontiers in Sports)</strong>: Provide race-specific volume
                distributions (e.g., Male Marathoners ~37mpw vs Female Rec ~17mpw).</li>
